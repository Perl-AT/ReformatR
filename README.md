# [ReformatR 1.0](https://github.com/Perl-AT/ReformatR)

---

This "shiny" app takes, as input, .csv reports from Med Associates Video Freeze and makes, as output, new .csv files containing only key data from the input file, reformatted so as to be readily handleable in R and SPSS. 

---

ReformatR exists as script in a .R document. To use, open ReformatR.R in R or RStudio and run the code -- the GUI ought to open in a new window. 

Before running, ensure that R and the "shiny" package are installed on your computer. 
If "shiny" package has not been installed, run `install.packages("shiny")` in R. 

---

This is an external README for opening the GUI. The GUI itself features a detailed internal README in a separate tab.
